Forecasting CO₂ Emissions to Support Climate Action (SDG 13)

- Problem Addressed:
Rising carbon emissions contribute to global warming and extreme weather events. Predicting future CO₂ levels helps governments and organizations plan effective climate interventions.

- ML Approach Used:
We applied a supervised learning model — specifically, Linear Regression — to predict future CO₂ emissions based on historical data (1960–2020).

Key Results:

- The model shows a continuously rising trend in emissions from 2025 to 2040.

- This supports the urgent need for renewable energy and sustainable policy decisions.

Ethical Considerations:

- Bias: Our data covers global averages — regional disparities in emissions are not considered.

- Fairness: Developing nations may appear as large emitters due to industrial growth; the model shouldn't be used to unfairly penalize them.

- Sustainability: The model encourages proactive climate planning, aligning with the global push for net-zero emissions.
